# BasketBall


This is a single screen Basket Ball App. It means in this app all task is performed on a single screen. This app has been created to count the score of the basketball. In this app, I used Button which is surrounded by the OnClickListener method by which all the buttons working properly and show the Text Message. Also, I made the Reset Button which is used to reset the game on pressing the Button.  In this app, the score of both the team is Counted properly and display on the top of the Basket Ball.
